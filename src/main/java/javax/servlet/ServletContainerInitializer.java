/**
 * Interface which allows a library/runtime to be notified of a web application's startup phase and perform any required
 * programmatic registration of servlets, filters, and listeners in response to it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may be annotated with {@link javax.servlet.annotation.HandlesTypes HandlesTypes},
 * in order to receive (at their {@link #onStartup} method) the Set of application classes that implement, extend, or
 * have been annotated with the class types specified by the annotation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an implementation of this interface does not use <code>HandlesTypes</code> annotation, or none of the application
 * classes match the ones specified by the annotation, the container must pass a <code>null</code> Set of classes to
 * {@link #onStartup}.
 *
 * <p>
 * When examining the classes of an application to see if they match any of the criteria specified by the
 * <code>HandlesTypes</code> annotation of a <code>ServletContainerInitializer</code>, the container may run into classloading
 * problems if any of the application's optional JAR files are missing. Because the container is not in a position to
 * decide whether these types of classloading failures will prevent the application from working correctly, it must
 * ignore them, while at the same time providing a configuration option that would log them.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be declared by a JAR file resource located inside the
 * <code>META-INF/services</code> directory and named for the fully qualified class name of this interface, and will be
 * discovered using the runtime's service provider lookup mechanism or a container specific mechanism that is
 * semantically equivalent to it. In either case, <code>ServletContainerInitializer</code> services from web fragment JAR
 * files excluded from an absolute ordering must be ignored, and the order in which these services are discovered must
 * follow the application's classloading delegation model.
 *
 * @see javax.servlet.annotation.HandlesTypes
